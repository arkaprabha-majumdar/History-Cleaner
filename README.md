# History-Cleaner

Think of all the times you had to remove all sites from your Chrome history tab.

- The lost minutes rejoining each page you didn't want to remove,
- Refetching everything, 
- Filling in all the forms again, etc

This extension solves all those problems.

**It's a simple extension - Enter a string, delete all sites in browser history that contain that string.**

# That's all ! Nothing more. Nothing less. :-)
